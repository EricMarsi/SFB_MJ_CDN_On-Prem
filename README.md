# SFB_MJ_CDN_On-Prem
This script is one that I thought would be fun to build, but also one that preserves part of the current experience of Skype for Business Server. Whenever Skype for Business Server is eventually retired, there is a chance that the CDN that delivers the modern meeting join experience ,since 2015 CU5, would be deprecated. This script not only works to preserve that functionality, but it also brings it fully on-premises so that if Microsoft's CDN is shut down, the service will still work. This works with Skype for Business Server 2015 CU5+ and 2019. A LOT of work went into this reverse engineering the processes that Microsoft built for this originally to work so I hope you enjoy!
